The old README is accessible here Terraform implementation will not be maintained anymore because of time, and mostly because it has become quite difficult to get feature parity with Terragrunt. Archive branch is available here Terraform/Terragrunt \u00b6 Terragrunt implementation is available in the terragrunt folder. Contributing \u00b6 Contribution are welcome, as well as issues, we are usually quite reactive. If you need more support for your project, do not hesitate to reach us directly . Requirements \u00b6 Terragrunt \u00b6 Terraform Terragrunt Quickstart \u00b6 Quickstart guide is available here or on the official documentation website Main purposes \u00b6 The main goal of this project is to glue together commonly used tooling with Kubernetes/EKS and to get from an AWS Account to a production cluster with everything you need without any manual configuration. What you get \u00b6 A production cluster all defined in IaaC with Terraform/Terragrunt: AWS VPC if needed based on terraform-aws-vpc EKS cluster base on terraform-aws-eks Kubernetes addons based on terraform-kubernetes-addons : provides various addons that are often used on Kubernetes and specifically on EKS. This module is currated by Particule and well maintained. Everything is tied together with Terragrunt and allows you to deploy a multi cluster architecture in a matter of minutes. Curated Features \u00b6 The additional features are provided by tEKS here as well as our curated addons module which support a bunch of various configuration. Bottlerocket support \u00b6 Bottlerocket OS is available for node groups (see example (here)[ https://github.com/particuleio/teks/tree/main/terragrunt/live/production/eu-west-1/clusters/demo/eks ]). Bottle rocket is a container centric OS with less attack surface and no default shell. AWS Session Manager by default \u00b6 All the instances (Bottlerocket or Amazon Linux) are registered with AWS Session Manager . No SSH keys or SSH access is open on instances. Shell access on every instance can be given with SSM for added security. aws ssm start-session --target INSTANCE_ID From and to Zero scaling with EKS Managed Node Groups \u00b6 tEKS support scaling to and from 0, even with using well know Kubernetes labels , there are a number of ongoing issues for support of EKS Managed node groups with Cluster Autoscaler . Thanks to automatic ASG tagging , tEKS adds the necessary tags on autoscaling group to balance similar node groups and allow you to scale to and from 0 and even to use well know labels such as node.kubernetes.io/instance-type or topology.kubernetes.io/zone . The logic can be extended to support other well known labels. Automatic dependencies upgrade \u00b6 We are using renovate to automatically open PR with the latest dependencies update (Terraform modules upgrade) so you never miss an upgrade and are alwasy up to date with the latest features. Enforced security \u00b6 Encryption by default for root volume on instances with Custom KMS Key AWS EBS CSI volumes encrypted by default with Custom KMS Key No IAM credentials on instances, everything is enforced with IRSA . Each addons is deployed in it's own namespace with sensible default network policies. Calico Tigera Operator for network policy. PSP are enabled but not enforced because of depreciation. Out of the box logging \u00b6 Three stacks are supported: * AWS for Fluent Bit : Forward containers logs to Cloudwatch Logs * Grafana Loki : Uses Promtail to forward logs to Loki . Grafana or a tEKS supported monitoring stack (see below) is necessary to display logs. Out of the box monitoring \u00b6 Prometheus Operator with defaults dashboards Addons that support metrics are enable along with their serviceMonitor Custom grafana dashboard are available by default Two stacks are supported: * Victoria Metrics Stack : Victoria Metrics is a Prometheus alertnative, compatible with prometheus CRDs * Kube Prometheus Stack : Classic Prometheus Monitoring Long term storage with Thanos \u00b6 With Prometheus, tEKS includes Thanos by default. Thanos uses S3 to store and query metrics, offering long term storage without the costs. For more information check out our article on the CNCF Blog Support for ARM instances \u00b6 With either Amazon Linux or BottleRocket, you can use a mix of ARM and AMD64 instances. Check out our example Helm v3 provider \u00b6 All addons support Helm v3 configuration All charts are easily customizable Other and not limited to \u00b6 priorityClasses for addons and critical addons lot of manual stuff have been automated under the hood Always up to date \u00b6 We always support the latest modules and features for our addons module . Our cutting edges addons include (not limited to): * AWS EBS CSI Drivers : Support for Volume encryption by default, snapshot, etc * AWS EFS CSI Drivers : Use AWS NFS shares. * Secret Store CSI Driver : load secret from Secret Managers with [ aws-secret-store-csi-driver ( https://github.com/aws/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-aws )] * Linkerd2 or Certificate Manager CSI for mTLS Requirements \u00b6 Terragrunt is not a hard requirement but all the modules are tested with Terragrunt. Terraform Terragrunt kubectl helm Pre-commit \u00b6 This repository use pre-commit hooks, please see this on how to setup tooling ASDF \u00b6 ASDF is a package manager which is great for managing cloud native tooling. More info here (eg. French). Enabling plugins \u00b6 for p in $(cut -d \" \" .tool-versions -f1); do asdf plugin add $p; done Installing tools \u00b6 asdf install Examples \u00b6 terragrunt/live folder provides an opinionated directory structure for a production environment. Additional infrastructure blocks \u00b6 If you wish to extend your infrastructure you can pick up additional modules on the particuleio github page . Some modules can also be found on the clusterfrak-dynamics github page .
